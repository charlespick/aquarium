On March 11th, 2023, the printer was paused in the morning after printing overnight. The toolhead was parked in the rear center of the printer instead of the back right corner. The printer was full of spaghetti, some of which had entered the heatbreak cooling fan, causing it to stall.

It is presumed that the tall print caused the printer to reach the height where the rear panel is so bowed that it causes enough friction on the xy belts to cause a signifigent amount of skipped steps. After this large amount of skipped steps, the amount of spaghetti generated was large enough to enter the heatbreak fan, causing the fan to stall. The dragon hotend is known to do two things when the hotend fan stalls, both of which occured here. The heatbreak clogged, causing the filament runout sensor to trip and pause the printer. And the heat from the extruder melted the afterburner.

In an attempt to unclog the dragon hotend, I tried to disassemble it but the screws stripped. This is the second time the hotend's assembly screws have stripped and the second time it has clogged from a stalled hotend. While a stalled hotend is not a regular operating condition, the Revo voron is known to not have this issue or the one regarding the assembly screws getting so tight that they are unremovable. 

As a result I am electing to install an ACM rear panel soon to eliminate the bowing of the rear panel and prevent skipped steps caused by this again. I am replacing the broken dragon hotend and afterburner with a Revo Voron setup that should be more reliable in the event of an extruder fan stall and should be easier to disassemble in the event of a clog again not suffering from assembly screws that get so tight from heat over time they strip.
